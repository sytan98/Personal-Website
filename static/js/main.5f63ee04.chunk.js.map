I was the expedition leader for an expedition to Gunung Tahan, Pahang, Malaysia in 2015. \r\n                            With the close guidance and advice by teachers in charge, I led the team to plan the expedition journey, prepare logistics and \r\n                            navigated our way to the summit and back over a span of 4 days. \r\n                            As the chairperson, I also oversaw welfare of my club members and assumed the roles of building up team spirit. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <li>Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) – Lieutenant (Commando) </li>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            I was an officer in the Commando vocation during my National Military Service with the Singapore Armed Forces \r\n                            from January 2017 to November 2018. I had to manage and motivate my detachment to perform under the most daunting \r\n                            circumstances. I learnt to be meticulous in planning and this would help me analyse data of the subject matter at hand. \r\n                            My experience from National Service has honed my leadership skills which I believe are crucial in driving engineering innovations \r\n                            and project management. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <li>AI for Industry – Practical Foundations in AI</li>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Completed Data Scientist Track on DataCamp, covering modules such as Data Manipulation with Pandas, Data Visualisation with Bokeh, \r\n                            Joining Data with SQL and Deep Learning with Keras.

I had a lot of fun working together with my teammates to do research and use various methods to train the \r\n                            model such that we can get the best possible accuracy. We explored various models before coming together and incorporating different ideas \r\n                            together to produce the best possible model. Racing against time, after the training phase and the presentation, we eventually emerged as \r\n                            winners, it was a very satisfying experience, knowing that every single teammate contributed to the team’s success. Through that hackathon, \r\n                            not only did I learn more about the various models that other teams used, I also learnt how to effectively work together in a team to code a \r\n                            solution to a machine learning problem.
