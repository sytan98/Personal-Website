                        <p>From December 2018 to March 2019, I did an internship with Defence Science Technology Agency (Singapore). 
                            My work comprised of researching and training various models that uses deep learning convolutional neural 
                            networks for human re-identification projects. I was also chosen to give a Machine Learning introduction with 
                            Google Colab workshop to high school students.

                        <li>Neuron Mobility</li>
                        <p>I also interned with Neuron Mobility Pte Ltd from June 2019 to September 2019, the largest E-scooter sharing 
                            start-up in Southeast Asia. I was a Data Intern and helped to run data analysis and build data pipelines on 
                            scooter and trip data. Joining at a phase of steep growth, I was also involved with other tasks such as the 
                            launch of operations in another city, enhancing my versatility and problem-solving skills.

                        <li>Dunman High School Outdoor Activities Club – Chairperson</li>
                        <p>
                            The club activities that we had were training and going to various courses on kayaking, abseiling and rock climbing. 
                            Eventually, we achieved Abseiling Level 2 Certification, Climbing Level 1 Certification and Kayaking Proficiency Personal Skill Two Star Award.
                            We also organise hiking expeditions. I was the expedition leader for an expedition to Gunung Tahan, Pahang, Malaysia in 2015. 
                            With the close guidance and advice by teachers in charge, I led the team to plan the expedition journey, prepare logistics and 
                            navigated our way to the summit and back over a span of 4 days. 
                            As the chairperson, I also oversaw welfare of my club members and assumed the roles of building up team spirit.

                        <li>Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) – Lieutenant (Commando) </li>
                        <p>
                            I was an officer in the Commando vocation during my National Military Service with the Singapore Armed Forces 
                            from January 2017 to November 2018. I had to manage and motivate my detachment to perform under the most daunting 
                            circumstances. I learnt to be meticulous in planning and this would help me analyse data of the subject matter at hand. 
                            My experience from National Service has honed my leadership skills which I believe are crucial in driving engineering innovations 
                            and project management.

                            This was hackathon organised by Defence Science Technology Agency (Singapore) where we had to build and train an image classifier than can tell 
                            what pose the human is making. I had a lot of fun working together with my teammates to do research and use various methods to train the 
                            model such that we can get the best possible accuracy. We explored various models before coming together and incorporating different ideas 
                            together to produce the best possible model. Racing against time, after the training phase and the presentation, we eventually emerged as 
                            winners, it was a very satisfying experience, knowing that every single teammate contributed to the team’s success. Through that hackathon, 
                            not only did I learn more about the various models that other teams used, I also learnt how to effectively work together in a team to code a 
                            solution to a machine learning problem. You can view a repository of the machine learning model in my github which the link is given
